The year is 1918, and after four years of conflict, the First World War is finally over. America has emerged as one of the victors, and is about to enter a period of economic prosperity and cultural change known as the Roaring Twenties. By 1929, America's total wealth has doubled, and investments are up 218% since 1922. But on October 24th, 1929, Black Thursday as it's called, the theorized start of the Great Depression, investors start to sell. At opening bell, things fall 11%. People are selling so much that price tickers can't keep up with the volume. The Dow Jones falls for another three years after this, losing 90% of its value from its high in 1929. By this point, bread lines, soup kitchens, and homelessness are common sights. Many lose their jobs as companies shut down, and it's not just investors that are hit. Some shares are now worthless, people have lost their life savings, and Americans who borrow to invest are absolutely crushed.
